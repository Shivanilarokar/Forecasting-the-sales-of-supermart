📊🏬 My first-ever Excel dashboard  (XYZ) E-commerce Store 🚀



Business Problem Statement: " Forecasting the sales for a US-based E-commerce store (XYZ), the outlet has various departments, and it must
stock up items that will be in demand in
each of these departments. However, while
stocking up, it must make sure that it does
not have excessive stock "  

Context: Here I have performed EDA and Forecasted the sales on the basis of past historical sales of 4 years (2015, 2016, 2017 & 2018) 
for the next 2 qtr of 2019 from the last dataset date!  
However, there are various Qualitative (Delphi method, jury of execution opinion, Market research, Consumer surveys & sales force feedback(ground level) &   
Quantitative ( Time series, Moving Averages, Exponential smoothing & regression analysis) methods of forecasting. 
In Microsoft Excel, we can perform forecasting by using forecast formulas, using Graph- trendline & using the forecast sheet option. I have used graph - trendline approach.

As we can see in the dashboard trendline is touching the maximum columns in the bar chart & a value of R² = 0.4814 (the ideal value of R² should be between 0 - 1 ) 
closer the value nearest to one shows the best forecast predictions. 1 is the ideal case & we never get that output 🤭
In my case, I applied a polynomial 3rd order model trendline which is giving the highest value of R² amongst various trendline options such as Exponential, linear, logarithmic, power, and Moving Average & forecasted it forward for the next 2 Quarters.

Some Key Insights:  

🚀 Sales forecasted for 2019 ( Qtr 1 & Qtr 2 ) is ~ between $ 3,00,000 - $ 3,50,000 that is inclination in the sales.

🚀 Top 5 Subcategories that are sold in the US according to the dataset 😉 are phones, chairs, storage, tables & Binders.

As I don't have actual sales in the dataset so I haven't calculated Forecast Accuracy, forecast error, 
 
   


Factors to keep in mind & need to be manually reconciled while doing a sales forecast to get a more accurate picture : 
Seasonal merchandise Peak
Price changes 
promotions 
Increased or decreased competition.
New product launch


Sales forecasting is very important  in planning,budgeting, & decision - Making & its purpose in aspects such as overproduction and short supply of raw materials, proper control of inventory, setting sales targets, 
timely & accurate replenishment ( Ol & OQ ) , avoid stock-outs.
